## Introduction

The music recommendation system aims to suggest songs to users based on their listening history and preferences. It utilizes machine learning techniques such as clustering to group similar songs and uses feature correlation to understand the underlying patterns in the data. Visualization tools, including Yellowbrick and t-SNE, help in understanding and presenting these patterns.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:
- Intermediate to advanced knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook
- Understanding of machine learning concepts, especially clustering
- Basic knowledge of data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
    cd music-recommendation-system
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes music features which related to metadata sourced from Spotify. Ensure you have access to a dataset containing features required.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is crucial for understanding the dataset and its underlying patterns. In this project, EDA involves:
- Summarizing the data
- Checking for missing values
- Visualizing feature distributions
- Identifying correlations between features

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used for clustering. This includes:
- Normalizing and scaling numerical features
- Encoding categorical features if necessary
- Creating additional features based on domain knowledge

## Clustering

Clustering is performed to group similar songs together. Techniques used include:
- K-Means clustering
- Evaluation of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and Silhouette score
- Using Yellowbrick for visualizing the clustering performance

## Visualization

Visualization techniques help in interpreting the clustering results:
- t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D space
- Visualizing clusters to understand the grouping of songs

## Building the Recommender System

The recommender system is built by:
- Importing Spotify's API to access song metadata
- Using the clustered data to find similar songs based on user preferences
- Implementing a recommendation algorithm to suggest songs

## Generating Recommendations

Recommendations are generated based on the user's listening history and preferences. The system identifies the cluster the userâ€™s preferred songs belong to and suggests songs from the same cluster.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the development of a sophisticated music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. By clustering songs and leveraging feature correlations, the system provides personalized recommendations. Visualization tools enhance the interpretability of the model, making it easier to understand and refine.
